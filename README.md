Subject: Support for app-qa4 Deployment and Gateway Mesh Configuration

Hi Beth,

We do have another namespace called app-qa4. Our pre-prod deployment is scheduled for June 18th, and the production release is planned for July 18th.

We may need your support to deploy the changes from app-qa2 to app-qa4. Based on my understanding, since we are working within a single cluster, I wanted to confirm: Are we allowed to host two Gateway mesh endpoints per service?

If thatâ€™s possible, we would like to give it a try before June 18th, as part of our pre-prod readiness efforts.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

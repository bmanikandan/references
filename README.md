Could you please guide us on ensuring that all our GM or LTM endpoints are correctly redirected to the new environment?

Our GTM endpoints are public-facing, and when a Trend hook is attached to the GM layer, the endpoint becomes unprotected and anonymous since virus scanning occurs before authentication and authorization. How are the TND teams addressing this issue?

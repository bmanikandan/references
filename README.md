Story Title: Analyze Split.io Feature Flag Integration for Backend Services (Exclude UI Integration)

Story Description:
As a development team, we need to evaluate the capabilities of Split.io feature flags to determine how they can be leveraged in our project for backend services. The analysis should focus on integration approaches, best practices, and any limitations, excluding UI-level integration.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Review Split.io documentation and SDKs for backend services.
	2.	Identify integration approaches suitable for our tech stack (e.g., Java, Spring).
	3.	Evaluate how feature flags can be used for:
	•	Gradual rollouts
	•	A/B testing (if applicable to backend logic)
	•	Kill switches / operational toggles
	4.	Document:
	•	Required configuration and environment setup
	•	Security and compliance considerations
	•	Performance impact (if any)
	5.	Provide a recommendation on how to adopt Split.io for backend services in this project.
	6.	Deliver a short PoC (if feasible) demonstrating basic flag evaluation in backend code.
	7.	UI integration explicitly excluded from this analysis.

Deliverables:
	•	Analysis document with findings and recommendations.
	•	PoC code repository (if created).
	•	Next steps for implementation.

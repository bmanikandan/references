The initial draft version of the library relies on Java RegEx, which compiles patterns for every single line sent to STDOUT, regardless of whether the text contains sensitive data. This is a time-consuming process, as the java.util.regex package uses a type of pattern-matching engine known as a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This engine is considered backtracking in natureâ€”while attempting to match a regular expression against a string, each character may be checked multiple times against various parts of the pattern, exhausting all possibilities before failing.

Since onboarding and underwriting processes frequently handle PII (Personally Identifiable Information), restrict the use of this library to only those domains. The abstraction layer and External Servicing team will defer integration until a more efficient solution is available, preferably one based on custom JSON serializers and deserializers.

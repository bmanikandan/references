Enterprise Architecture (EA) team is waiting for Retail to issue a GREEN signal to C&IB to be able to take over the ownership of Temporal Free Open-Source product as soon as possible. 08-15-2022 09:27:11 - Temporal.io v1.17.2 (Open Source)
On August 2022, the Retail Innovation team submitted a ticket that was approved for a proof of concept. There was no further action taken by them after the POC.

11-12-2024 22:00:26 - Temporal.io v1.25.2 (Open Source)
The C&IB Merchant Services team submitted this ticket in November 2024, and it has been stuck since then. As the EA team is concerned, we are unable to move forward until the Retail agrees to transfer Temporalio ownership over to us.

There is a request from Retail Innovation that they review our use cases to see if they have already tried those scenarios or not. If both are different, Retail & CSIB will combine and work together on the case.
The development of the project.
The Retail Innovation team has already developed a custom-built in-house product, so if our use case would fit into their custom-built in-house product, we might be able to proceed to launch it.
The request has been made to set up a meeting with Michael.Minella@PNC.com in order to discuss our use cases in more detail.
Here is a list of use cases we shared with Ordonez Rick M today.

Injection of workflows based on regulatory requirements, if any, on an as-needed basis.

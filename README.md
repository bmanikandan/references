The CAP Team appears to be moving toward adopting Kafka and standardizing on a single architectural solution, based on the assumption that Kafka inherently delivers speed improvements for both asynchronous and synchronous payment flows.

Synchronous payments refer to transactions processed in real-time or near real-time, where the response is received immediately. In contrast, asynchronous payments involve a delay between the initiation and final resolution of the transaction—processing can take from a few minutes to several days, depending on the payment rail used (e.g., WIRE, ACH).

However, this direction raises concerns for both types of flows. It appears to be more of a technical debt route rather than a well-grounded architectural decision, driven by assumptions rather than validated needs. Additionally, there’s an expectation for CAP to generate trace IDs using a custom open-source algorithm based on timestamps and random text, rather than leveraging standardized enterprise tools. This introduces unpredictability and complexity in managing trace ID uniqueness, especially when their existing custom algorithm, though scaled to millions of payments, lacks enterprise-level controls to prevent duplication.

CAP continues to assert that “the business wants to use Kafka,” but in reality, this direction appears to be largely driven by a contractor who strongly believes this is the best architectural fit for PNC’s flows. Unfortunately, this vision is being justified by leaning on business input rather than aligning with sound technical strategy or enterprise architectural principles. The absence of strong internal guidance to challenge or validate this approach only deepens the risk of misalignment with what PNC truly needs.

Quite often, there is a subjective interpretation of the term "less work", for example, if Scepter fails to hold the mechanism of data restrictions and isolation for the LOB systems, they will have to develop the missing capabilities on their own, the work would be spread across multiple systems which will cause delays and results that fall below expectations.

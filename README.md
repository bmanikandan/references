Improvement Area 1: External Web Client Architecture
	•	Implement independent module architecture where client servers maintain their own session lifecycles
	•	Integrate modern authentication mechanisms with KeepAlive functionality at the system level
Improvement Area 2: Secure Identity Management
	•	Avoid exchanging sensitive identities (CompanyId) via SAMLResponse to service applications
	•	Implement secure identity token patterns
Improvement Area 3: Centralized Authorization
	•	Avoid having each module maintain its own authorization patterns
	•	Establish unified authorization framework
Improvement Area 4: Session Management
	•	Address multiple logout calls from external web clients
	•	Implement coordinated session termination
The main improvements I made:
	•	Fixed spelling and grammar errors
	•	Organized the content with clear headings and bullet points
	•	Clarified technical terminology
	•	Separated the mixed “Improvement Area 3” into distinct areas
	•	Made the language more professional and readable
Would you like me to adjust the technical terminology or formatting further?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


Welcome
Improvement Area 1: External Web Client Architecture
	•	Implement independent module architecture where client servers maintain their own session lifecycles
	•	Integrate modern authentication mechanisms with KeepAlive functionality at the system level
Improvement Area 2: Secure Identity Management
	•	Avoid exchanging sensitive identities (CompanyId) via SAML Response to service applications
	•	Implement secure identity token patterns
Improvement Area 3: Centralized Authorization
	•	Avoid having each module maintain its own authorization patterns
	•	Establish a unified authorization framework
Improvement Area 4: Session Management
	•	Address multiple logout calls from external web clients
	•	Implement coordinated session termination
Key grammar corrections made:
	•	“maintainz” → “maintain”
	•	“tieir” → “their”
	•	“authoization” → “authorization”
	•	“Exchnage” → “exchanging”
	•	Added articles (“a unified framework”)
	•	Fixed sentence structure and verb tenses
	•	Corrected “SAMLResponse” → “SAML Response”
	•	Improved parallel structure in bullet points
The text now follows proper grammar rules while maintaining the technical accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

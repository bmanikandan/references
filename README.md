I am part of the Scepter Projects team, and the DI PING setup is scheduled to go live tonight. Mrudula and Shashank mentioned your name as a point of contact.

After the DI setup, we would like to validate the implementation using an existing Mobile Accept Prod test login account. Could you please share the details of any available test account?

Looking forward to your response.

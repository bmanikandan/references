Good Morning Team,

This is a gentle reminder that we are still facing the issue that was reported earlier a couple of times. Unfortunately, due to this, QA deployments have been failing consistently for the past three days.

We would appreciate it if this could be prioritized and resolved at the earliest convenience, as it is impacting our testing timelines.

Thank you for your support.

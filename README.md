Here‚Äôs a comprehensive breakdown of how to identify, respond to, and report merchant fraud:

üîç 1. Identified Signs That Might Indicate a Merchant is Fraudulent
Unusual or inconsistent transaction patterns

Spikes in volume without clear business growth

Large number of refunds, chargebacks, or cancellations

Mismatch in business details

Business name, address, or phone doesn‚Äôt match known records

Domain is recently registered or lacks history

High-risk industries or behavior

Operating in known high-risk sectors (e.g., supplements, adult, crypto)

Involvement in pyramid schemes or fake affiliate traffic

Suspicious financial behavior

Rapid funds withdrawal after transactions

Use of multiple merchant accounts (a.k.a. "merchant account laundering")

Identity red flags

Falsified documents or inconsistent information during KYC

üö® 2. Course of Action Once Merchant is Identified as Fraudulent
Stage	Action
Initial Detection	Flag account for review; freeze suspicious transactions temporarily
Investigation	Run deep checks on documents, transaction logs, IP geolocation, linked accounts
Escalation	Involve internal risk/fraud teams or external investigators
Resolution	Suspend or terminate account, reverse payouts, or withhold funds
Legal	If necessary, refer to law enforcement, initiate recovery/legal claims

üõí 3. How Strange Purchases or Transactions Are Identified as Fraud
These anomalies often trigger fraud alerts:

Geolocation mismatch
e.g., User registered in New York but transacts from Nigeria within minutes

Rapid-fire transactions
Many small purchases in short time (fraud testing stolen cards)

Mismatch in card and customer info
Billing name doesn't match account holder

Excessive refund or dispute patterns

Transactions at odd hours or holidays

High-risk product categories (e.g., luxury goods, gift cards)

Use fraud scoring engines or ML models trained to spot these anomalies.

üß≠ 4. How to Identify Unusual Activity (Monitoring Techniques)
Use a combination of:

Behavioral analytics
Track user behavior over time ‚Äî e.g., login frequency, device fingerprint, location hopping

Transaction profiling
Look for deviations from average ticket size, volume, time of day

Velocity checks
Detect rapid transactions across different cards or merchants

Device & IP intelligence
Flag TOR, VPN, emulators, or device spoofing

Blacklist comparison
Check against known fraudster or scam merchant databases

üì¢ 5. How & Where to Report Fraud
Internal Reporting (Enterprise or Platform Level):
Raise a fraud case to Risk/Fraud or Compliance Team

Use internal case management tools (e.g., Jira, Salesforce)

Lock account or put on hold until reviewed

External Reporting (If Needed):
Agency/Platform	Where to Report
Banks / PSPs	Contact their fraud support department
Card networks	Visa: Visa Fraud Reporting

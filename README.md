üì¶ Scepter Error Handling Library for Spring Boot

This library provides a standardized, robust error-handling mechanism for RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot. It is designed to minimize ambiguity, reduce boilerplate, and ensure that all error responses are handled consistently and clearly‚Äîregardless of developer interpretation or custom exception design.

‚úÖ Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Standards-Compliant Error Format
	‚Ä¢	Implements RFC 9457 ‚Äî Problem Details for HTTP APIs, published July 2023.
	‚Ä¢	Supports extended, non-standard members to enable actionable client behavior based on error codes.
	‚Ä¢	Accurate HTTP Status Codes
	‚Ä¢	Errors return proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, 500, etc.) based on the error context.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures that error semantics match the underlying cause.
	‚Ä¢	Detailed, Structured Error Responses
	‚Ä¢	Includes a unique error code, human-readable message, and context-specific details.
	‚Ä¢	Designed to help clients understand and fix issues quickly.
	‚Ä¢	Internationalization (i18n) Support
	‚Ä¢	Default locale: en-US.
	‚Ä¢	Seamless localization via message property files (messages_es.properties, messages_ja.properties, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	No additional coding required to support new languages.
	‚Ä¢	Unified Exception Treatment
	‚Ä¢	Treats JDK exceptions and domain-specific custom exceptions equally.
	‚Ä¢	Always produces a consistent response structure.
	‚Ä¢	Fail-Fast Constraint Validation
	‚Ä¢	Bean validation uses a fail-fast strategy to reduce CPU cycles for invalid requests.
	‚Ä¢	Improves API performance by rejecting bad requests early in the request lifecycle.

üìå Benefits
	‚Ä¢	Developers don‚Äôt need to write boilerplate error handlers or worry about consistency.
	‚Ä¢	Clients get predictable and machine-readable error responses.
	‚Ä¢	Easy integration into any Spring Boot

 application without heavy customization.

Scepter Error Handling Library

Unified, Standardized Error Responses for Reactive and Non-Reactive Spring Boot APIs

This library enforces consistent and standards-based error handling across both reactive and non-reactive RESTful Spring Boot applications, aligning with the goals of the Scepter initiative. It simplifies and centralizes how errors are managed, formatted, localized, and communicated to clients‚Äîminimizing low-level customization while ensuring precise, predictable behavior.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Highlights
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Dual Support:
Built for both spring-webmvc (non-reactive) and spring-webflux (reactive) Spring Boot applications. One dependency, one configuration‚Äîreactive or not.
	‚Ä¢	üìñ RFC 9457 Compliant:
Follows the IETF RFC 9457 ‚Äì Problem Details for HTTP APIs specification, with extensions to include actionable, domain-specific error codes and metadata.
	‚Ä¢	üì° HTTP-Accurate Responses:
Uses the correct HTTP status code for every failure scenario (400, 404, 409, etc.), ensuring that APIs communicate errors with both semantic and protocol-level accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	üß© Structured and Actionable Error Body:
Every error response contains:
	‚Ä¢	type: URI identifying the error category
	‚Ä¢	title: Short, human-readable summary
	‚Ä¢	status: HTTP status
	‚Ä¢	detail: Descriptive explanation
	‚Ä¢	code: Application-specific code (for client logic)
	‚Ä¢	instance: Request URI
	‚Ä¢	errors (optional): Field-level validation or context info
	‚Ä¢	üåç i18n Localization:
	‚Ä¢	Default Locale: en-US
	‚Ä¢	Easily extensible to support languages such as Spanish, Japanese, German, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Localization done through messages_{locale}.properties with no extra code.
	‚Ä¢	üìõ Consistent Exception Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Treats JDK exceptions and custom application exceptions equally.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically maps known exceptions (e.g., IllegalArgumentException, ConstraintViolationException, custom DomainException) to the standard error model.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö° Fast-Fail Bean Validation:
	‚Ä¢	Enabled by default using Hibernate Validator‚Äôs fail-fast mode.
	‚Ä¢	Rejects unhealthy/invalid requests quickly, reducing resource waste.

‚∏ª

üß© Integration

Include the library and it auto-configures the global exception handling via:
	‚Ä¢	@ControllerAdvice for Spring MVC
	‚Ä¢	@ExceptionHandler or functional routing filters for WebFlux

‚∏ª

üì¶ Target Use Case

This library is ideal for any Spring Boot-based microservice‚ÄîREST APIs, gateways, reactive services‚Äîthat wants to:
	‚Ä¢	Avoid reinventing error-handling patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain predictable and consistent API contracts.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce standards compliance without low-level boilerplate.

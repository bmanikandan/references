There are four ENVs that make up the APP mnemonic: R&D, UAT, QA, and PROD. We would like to keep MongoDB, Kafka, PNC Inner API ClientID, and Client Secrets passwords at Password Vault in order to maintain them in a secure location. Initially, the passwords will be set up by the application team. I would prefer to have OCP get the PWDs and Vauft and then run the PODS after getting the PWDs and Vauft.

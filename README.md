I have sent all our leads and OCP leads genuine radically candid feedback about single-pod. OCP raised their concerns about single-pod years, but Retail continues to use single-pod knowing or unknowing, spreading as a virus across teams. Our C&IB was repeatedly forced to use a single pod to consume Retail entitlements in the name of X-team or Y-team. For us, that's an easy-out. Retail Innovation can only stop this by declaring single-pod as an anti-pattern or using OCP within the dedisclaimer zone.

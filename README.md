The term dispute refers to a customer grievance about a particular transaction that they have experienced. A dispute with a customer precedes a chargeback. The dispute is basically a complaint filed by a customer to their credit card issuer or bank that results in the institution reversing the payment that was made by the customer.
When a cardholder disputes a credit card transaction and asks their bank to reverse the payment, this is known as a chargeback. As a result, the cardholders seek to obtain this remediation through the chargeback-dispute process, which occurs when the issuer reverses a payment in response to a complain from a cardholder after conducting some due diligence.
In order to fight invalid chargebacks, chargeback representation is a systematized and rigorous process that must be followed. The procedure of chargeback representation involves presenting evidence, such as a copy of the sales receipt or proof of delivery, to the customer's bank in order to prove to them that the transaction is legitimate.

API testing will resume following the 10/3 sign-off. To date, testing has been conducted using a single company and operator. However, because Oracle leverages intelligent caching, repeated SQL queries may return results from cache, which can limit the accuracy of testing. To ensure comprehensive validation, future testing will include multiple users and a variety of entitlement combinations.

The expectations and test company details will be documented in Confluence for reference.

Hi Sharon,

I was previously under the impression that no decision had been made regarding the wave migration. This understanding was based on the fact that Tarun had been working on an analysis task over the last two weeks during the previous sprint, and had also submitted an onboarding request for Split IO.

However, I would like to clarify whether any interim decisions have been made in the meantime. Spending time and effort under the guise of analysis—if a decision has already been made—is counterproductive and a misuse of resources.

If a decision has been made, I strongly recommend that we formally document it in an ADR (Architecture Decision Record), clearly outlining:
	•	The chosen option
	•	The decision owner
	•	The pros and cons of the selected approach

This will help avoid further time spent revisiting or debating alternatives unnecessarily.

Specifically, can you please confirm:
	•	Who is the decision owner for using the PIANCLE Wave Table?

Please also note that the long-term enterprise strategy is to proceed with Split IO, targeted for the November 2025 release, only if the business decides to revisit and allocate budget accordingly after the initial release.

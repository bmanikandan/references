Subject: Feature Flag Management for Portal Renovation

Hi Team,

As part of the upcoming portal renovations, we initially planned to introduce Split IO to manage our feature flags. This would have enabled us to:

Release features in a phased and controlled manner

Reduce risks by limiting exposure during rollouts

Run A/B tests and experiments to validate performance and adoption

Increase overall confidence in deployments

However, we came to know that using Split IO was not approved by the Enterprise Architecture team. Please suggest if there are any approved alternatives to Split IO that we can adopt. Options such as LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or Azure App Configuration could be potential candidates, but we would like guidance on what is permitted.

Also, please let us know what is required to bring this initiative into the PWO Renovation space, so we can plan accordingly and align dependencies.

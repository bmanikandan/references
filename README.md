We started this effort from the point you have contacted us, in which you have expressed your concern that Scrum calls are turning into FAQ calls, where you are pointing to one person as a bottleneck. The reason for this is that there is no clarity in the stories and no reference to the business requirements. As a result, the developers do not know what to do or where to refer to when they have scrum calls. The result of this is that the calls are turned into endless hours of discussion each day as a result of this. To crack this problem, I created two stories in the current sprint SCEP-1231 and SCEP-3331 as a role model in order to illustrate how to tackle this problem in the language that technical developers are familiar with, in order to avoid FAQs, as well as try to reinvent ourselves, though I wasn't hired for a BSA position. As soon as I requested to follow something similar as SCEP-1231 and SCEP-3331 to others and collect business requirements, classify title with prefix, I was able to get it done. There was no way I expected it to turn out this way. As soon as we began the discussion of this template, everyone volunteered to demonstrate their experience and strength. The discussion about this template is correct, as we should not follow the template created by PNC, as we have discussed in the past. The discussion ended in a deadlock, and you unfortunately played a role in this deadlock by saying, on Friday's call, that we should not attempt to teach you how to create stories, which contributed to the deadlock.
People who caused deadlock know the reasons why their experience was not applied in a full capacity from the date of starting until the end of last week by the people who created deadlock. I don't understand why if one person moves forward with one step, others would push back so hard in order to create deadlocks.

Copilot provides different suggestions depending on the existing code. The current code repository is a fully Reactive REST API. A 10-minute load test was conducted in QA2, which processed 11,273 HTTP requests using only 40 threads. While Copilot’s suggestions could not be used directly, with minor adjustments they worked successfully, making it a great companion in development.

As of last week, we have moved to Code Freeze for the October 3rd release.

We used DiffBlue in combination with Copilot for JUnit testing. Copilot’s reactor-based suggestions for mocks turned out to be a great companion. Of course, Copilot cannot be directly compared with Cursor IDE or other agentic tools, but its ability to generate JavaDocs and provide inline code suggestions while writing was impressive.

Regarding a new technology request, OracleGraalM Enterprise Edition, which needs to be added to C&IB's technology stack.

We have submitted a FOOS request to EASTR. In reviewing the license agreement, we have learned that the development use of Oracle GRAALVM Enterprise Edition is free, but the production use of Oracle GRAALVM Enterprise Edition requires a subscription.

For this technology to be used in PNC's world, EAST team requires a stargic sourcing ID to link the ticket.

We require your help to start the process for GraalVM.

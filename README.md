Cloud Native journey simplified with GraalVM. It runs at the speed of underlays. Java Nanoservices developed with GraalVM are cloud-ready and more efficient, while preserving the Java ecosystem's benefits. Faster start up and lower CPU and memory usage reduce hardware costs, especially at scale with high-load banking systems.

Let the pagination be automatic for the top 10,000 latest transaction. PIT creates views on the frozen datasets and stay until the keep-alive ends.
Not all users view all pages, some jump to VT or Reports from the first page. Tempura servers may start evicting stale keep-alive connections if we open multiple long-duration keep-alive connections, which causes a lot of overhead.

As the demands for a faster, flexible, and scalable digital payment system continue to grow, the Merchant Service industry is constantly evolving to meet these demands. With the help of this platform, merchants have the unique opportunity to manage payments across all channels securely in one place and ensure that all payments are accepted and processed securely and smoothly. Typical merchant services include the following services, but there are many others as well.

Onboarding Experience - Every new merchant's journey starts here.

Risk and Underwriting Experience - The process of determining the risk involved in enabling the merchant's requested services through the client's information and background.

Device Provisioning Experience - This service is designed to provide businesses with a point-of-sale system that can be used either on the counter or taken to the customer's home to sell goods and services.

Consumer Portal - The Consumer Portal is a single platform that allows merchants to manage all payments across all channels in a secure, easy-to-use manner.

Payment Gateway Experience

Customers are able to submit online payment details via its Ul interface, including credit card or debit card numbers, and this information will be routed to the merchant's payment processor so they can process the payment. There are other channels listed as well that work in the same way. There are three levels of processing that can be performed with the Card method.

LEVEL I - Credit card transactions submitted at Level 1 have the lowest information, leading to potentially higher costs.

LEVEL II and LEVEL III - Credit card transactions submitted with these levels of card data can qualify for reduced interchange rates. This will result in lower costs for merchants to process credit card transactions. There is no doubt that merchants would do well to submit Level 2 and Level 3 card data whenever possible.

Online Transaction Processing Experience - Ability to accept credit/debit card payments online via a virtual terminal or on your ecommerce website using a virtual terminal or a virtual terminal software.

Mobile transaction processing experience - Looking for a business that is looking to accept credit/debit cards on the go.

Merchant entitlements

This entitlement system was designed at the very early stages of the project; as a result, there is room for future upgrades to be made.

 

Microservices, in a way, was the next step in the evolution of SOA. Similarly, nanoservices can be considered as the evolved form of microservices architecture.
The system is based on the Google research paper Zanzibar, Google's Consistent, Global Authorization System. The bank faces various challenges to establish varying levels of secure business account access for bookkeepers, office managers, key employees, and even CPAs. Allows business owners to delegate cash management activities without sacrificing control or security.
  Provide secure and confident access management via Fine Grained Access Control
Quickly implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in Banking applications.
  Easy control of applications with Policy Based Access.
Supports millions of authorization requests per second and trillions of access control lists. 
Once nanoservices are deployed, they give an additional level of flexibility as they allow you to chain together different services.
components of nanoservices are too fine-grained as compared to microservices. There’s no need to duplicate code in nanoservices to be deployed.

This service offers searchable APIs that allow merchants to search transactions made through these channels, and is constantly evolving to meet merchant needs.

A nanoservice by structure is intended to do one task at a time only, and present it as a single API endpoint. With nanoservices, each command is likely to be separate but on the other hand, microservices often have multiple commands.

Listed below are Some of the Benefits of Using Nanoservices in your Projects:

A nanoservice can have its own security protocol
Flexibility to use different services
Easy to deploy
Nanoservice can be created according to its own schedule
Nanoservices can be clustered together to form a usable application

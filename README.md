Our team (Oscar) is experiencing a NULL target Company ID issue after enabling JWT token-based authentication on the BSA Entitlement page. There may be a need for a code fix at the Portal side, which requires deployment of applications (pwo-pwop-app and pwo-pwoip-app) and the CE BSA SSO Common Gateway in conjunction with pwo-pps-bsa-apx.

As soon as the deployment has been completed, I will let you know and update the version numbers at the Mock deployment request accordingly.

Cloud Native journey simplified with GraalVM. It runs at the speed of underlays. Java Nanoservices developed with GraalVM are cloud-ready and more efficient, while preserving the Java ecosystem's benefits. Faster start up and lower CPU and memory usage reduce hardware costs, especially at scale with high-load banking systems.



Microservices, in a way, was the next step in the evolution of SOA. Similarly, nanoservices can be considered as the evolved form of microservices architecture.
The system is based on the Google research paper Zanzibar, Google's Consistent, Global Authorization System. The bank faces various challenges to establish varying levels of secure business account access for bookkeepers, office managers, key employees, and even CPAs. Allows business owners to delegate cash management activities without sacrificing control or security.
  Provide secure and confident access management via Fine Grained Access Control
Quickly implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in Banking applications.
  Easy control of applications with Policy Based Access.
Supports millions of authorization requests per second and trillions of access control lists. 
Once nanoservices are deployed, they give an additional level of flexibility as they allow you to chain together different services.
components of nanoservices are too fine-grained as compared to microservices. There’s no need to duplicate code in nanoservices to be deployed.

This service offers searchable APIs that allow merchants to search transactions made through these channels, and is constantly evolving to meet merchant needs.

A nanoservice by structure is intended to do one task at a time only, and present it as a single API endpoint. With nanoservices, each command is likely to be separate but on the other hand, microservices often have multiple commands.

Listed below are Some of the Benefits of Using Nanoservices in your Projects:

A nanoservice can have its own security protocol
Flexibility to use different services
Easy to deploy
Nanoservice can be created according to its own schedule
Nanoservices can be clustered together to form a usable application

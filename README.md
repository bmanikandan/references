The questions are relevant to Java and Spring Boot. If a candidate says they have been developing Java applications for over 20 years, they must be able to explain their code from previous deliverables or provide a detailed explanation of how they obtained their Java experience. It is too expansive and time consuming to look for a Clerk level developer who expects samples and guidance during every phase of the project or someone who will write the code so he can accomplish the remaining tasks, because that would require too much time.

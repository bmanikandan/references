I am writing to follow up on my recent onshore FTE VDI request that was rejected, and to provide additional business justification for reconsideration.
Background:
My previous VDI access was removed without prior notification, which has significantly impacted my ability to perform essential work functions. I have submitted a new request under guidance from the Powerlink Agent, but require clarification on the rejection reasons to ensure proper resubmission.
Business Justification:
I am currently using an Apple Mac laptop, however, several critical work functions require VDI access:
	1.	Production System Access: Certain applications for production work are only accessible through VDI environment
	2.	Compatibility Testing: Project-related compatibility testing can only be performed within the VDI infrastructure
	3.	Security Compliance: VDI access is necessary to maintain proper security protocols for production system interactions
Request:
	1.	Please provide specific reasons for the rejection so I can address any concerns in a resubmission
	2.	Clarify any additional documentation, approvals, or compliance requirements needed
	3.	Consider temporary access arrangements while the formal approval process is completed
	4.	Provide timeline expectations for resolution
Business Impact:
The lack of VDI access is preventing me from:
	•	Accessing critical production applications
	•	Completing required compatibility testing
	•	Meeting project deliverables and timelines
I am available to discuss this request further and provide any additional information needed to expedite the approval process.
Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.

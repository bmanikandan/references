In the name of tools, the topic was derailed. It is not important whether you use JIRA or an Excel spreadsheet. 

An Excel sheet was created in which all remaining work sets were recorded and identified.
   Are there stories created for each item in the Excel sheet that is similar to the one we just created?
   Can you please confirm that the work sets are allotted distributed access during Sprint 1 and Spring 2 and so on in order to meet the commitment date as mid-November 2024?

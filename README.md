As part of our digital modernization journey, the new PINACLE platform is being reimagined with fully Reactive REST APIs to meet the demands of a multi-brand architecture, support high-concurrency user traffic, and enable web-scale growth.

To achieve this, we are intentionally moving away from traditional, blocking API frameworks in favor of non-blocking, event-driven architectures that support reactive programming models. This modern approach aligns with best practices for scalability, performance, and cloud-native readiness.

We look forward to your support and collaboration in this strategic transformation, as we build a resilient, scalable, and future-ready solution together.

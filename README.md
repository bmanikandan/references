Observations:
	•	The current documentation captures the underlying technology stack but lacks important details.

Action Items:
	1.	Design a Generic Report Generation Architecture
Develop a reusable and extensible report generation framework that can support multiple use cases, including both CommEx and Refail.
	2.	File Format Support
The architecture should allow reading from and writing to a variety of file formats, such as:
	•	HTML
	•	CSV
	•	Excel
	•	PDF (initial focus should be on PDF)
	3.	Scalability for Different Business Models
Ensure support for:
	•	Single-merchant, single-store environments
	•	Multi-merchant, multi-store environments
	4.	Template Management
	•	Implement a template versioning system to track changes and roll back when needed.
	•	Support merchant-specific templates to allow customization per merchant while leveraging common reusable components.
	5.	Handling Incomplete or Partial Data
Define a strategy to deal with “half-cooked” or incomplete data, such as:
	•	Graceful fallbacks (e.g., placeholders or warnings)
	•	Logging and alerting mechanisms
	•	Validation and cleanup routines before report generation


Robust Handling of Incomplete or Partial Data (“Half-Cooked Data”)

Incomplete or inconsistent input data is a common challenge in report generation. The architecture should proactively manage these scenarios through a combination of validation, transformation, and fallback strategies. Key considerations include:

a. Pre-Generation Data Validation
	•	Implement a validation layer that checks for:
	•	Missing mandatory fields (e.g., transaction amount, customer name)
	•	Invalid formats (e.g., malformed dates, corrupted file encodings)
	•	Business rule violations (e.g., negative prices, unlinked store IDs)
	•	Flag and categorize data issues by severity (critical vs. warning)

b. Fallback and Placeholder Mechanisms
	•	Use default values or placeholders (e.g., “N/A”, “Data Missing”) to ensure reports can still be generated gracefully when data is incomplete.
	•	Mark sections with incomplete data using visual cues (icons, colors, footnotes) for transparency.

c. Error Logging and Reporting
	•	Log all instances of data anomalies with full traceability (record ID, field name, error type).
	•	Generate a summary of data issues along with the report to aid downstream debugging or reconciliation.

d. Data Correction Interfaces (Optional for Advanced Use Cases)
	•	Provide UI tools or APIs for manual or automated data correction workflows prior to report finalization.
	•	Enable re-submission or re-processing of corrected datasets.

e. Configurable Tolerance Levels
	•	Allow merchants or system administrators to define acceptable thresholds for data completeness (e.g., “allow report generation if at least 90% of fields are populated”).

f. Test and Simulate with Dummy/Partial Data
	•	Ensure the report engine is tested against synthetic and intentionally incomplete datasets to verify robustness and formatting resilience.

Fratus John made a valid point. In the case of development use, the pre-build binary version downloaded from the Oracle GraalVM website will stick to the Early Adopted version. In the case of production use, we may have to use the Enterprise version for native image builds. 

Even in the current DevOps environment, the developers uses Oracle JDK for development, but in production DevOps use the Red Hat version of Open JDK. 

Please convert this request to GraalVM Enterprise Edition.

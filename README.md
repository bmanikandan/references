Microservices, in a way, was the next step in the evolution of SOA. Similarly, nanoservices can be considered as the evolved form of microservices architecture.

Once nanoservices are deployed, they give an additional level of flexibility as they allow you to chain together different services.
components of nanoservices are too fine-grained as compared to microservices. There’s no need to duplicate code in nanoservices to be deployed.

A nanoservice by structure is intended to do one task at a time only, and present it as a single API endpoint. With nanoservices, each command is likely to be separate but on the other hand, microservices often have multiple commands.

Listed below are Some of the Benefits of Using Nanoservices in your Projects:

A nanoservice can have its own security protocol
Flexibility to use different services
Easy to deploy
Nanoservice can be created according to its own schedule
Nanoservices can be clustered together to form a usable application

The people are blindly following and being forced to follow, more than one container in a single pod, which is unacceptable. Using HTTPS as a primary channel, outer containers communicate with inner containers inside a single-pod using AUTH 2.0 PING and Brarrer tolen validations (among other things).
These concepts are over-enforced by some teams, and they act as a de-facto pattern across the entire organization. Additionally, Ledership team is enforcing blindly the copy-paste Artcuture mistakes and they are forcing their teams to follow the same mistakes without understanding the nuances behind the patterns described above.
As an example, a single pod may contain several containers where the outermost container handles a lot of user traffic whereas not all calls require the whole inner service to be connected at the same time. In the user information, some services may be used ten times a day, some may not, a lot of read-only calls may be made. Thus, it is important to treat everything equally and to make sure all of the inter APIs are written carefully with the intention of making better use of the resources instead of putting together a lot of CPUs and memory intensive code.

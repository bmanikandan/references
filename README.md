Thank you Jane, please include the security team and Akamai leadership sharing their challenges. According to Sandhya RFC 9110 released on June 2023, 402 is not a standard status code. Since 2005, all were reserved for future use. Newly evolved online banking as a service platforms use HttpStatusCode 402. I'm glad you quoted Master Card and Stripe.  Delivering something now and making changes later is not possible with SaaS products because there are scenarios closed for modifications and open for extensions (open close principle).

In the architecture Decision Record, we will record this email as-is.

Hi Vijay and Mahe,

It is the fifth scenario of CAP enforcing their decisions to PPS and PPD. This is the good candidate to invite World Wide Web (W3) or INternet Engineering Task Force (IETF) auditors and audit the CAP apis. Will connect and shared the details when time permits.

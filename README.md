There has been no conclusion drawn regarding the storage of entitlements at the LOB Entitlement data source as yet. A follow-up conversation will be scheduled in two weeks time as a result of this discussion.

The association between the MDM Party ID and the RNID remains at the APP MongoDB. The MDM Party ID is sent to all APIs and the RNID is retrieved by using MongoDB calls.

Work In Take Requests should be submitted to Retail Entitlements for the acceptance of MDM Party IDs as well as one or more RNIDs, including locations, for the intake process. Submit a work-in-progress request to enhance Retail CSA page for Merchants in order to improve user experience.

Work in Take requests to PINACLE PWO should be submitted for the purpose of storing MDM Party IDs, Company IDs, and one or more RNIDs with a maximum number of locations being up to 500.   Work in Take request for Enhancement of CSA page for Merchants for PINCALE users should be submitted to PINACLE PWO team.

There are known performance bottlenecks and limitations associated with the use of PINACLE Entitlement APIs. This directly impacts the performance of the merchant applications. In the coming weeks, Sathish will discuss this with the PWO group.â€¨OpenFGA is not included in MVP v1.1. This may be revised after the first point has been resolved.  For the next two weeks, all entitlement stories will be put on hold.   

Focus on the MVP v1.1 release items.

Improvement Area 1: External Web Client Architecture
	•	Implement independent module architecture where client servers maintain their own session lifecycles
	•	Integrate modern authentication mechanisms with KeepAlive functionality at the system level
Improvement Area 2: Secure Identity Management
	•	Avoid exchanging sensitive identities (CompanyId) via SAMLResponse to service applications
	•	Implement secure identity token patterns
Improvement Area 3: Centralized Authorization
	•	Avoid having each module maintain its own authorization patterns
	•	Establish unified authorization framework
Improvement Area 4: Session Management
	•	Address multiple logout calls from external web clients
	•	Implement coordinated session termination
The main improvements I made:
	•	Fixed spelling and grammar errors
	•	Organized the content with clear headings and bullet points
	•	Clarified technical terminology
	•	Separated the mixed “Improvement Area 3” into distinct areas
	•	Made the language more professional and readable
Would you like me to adjust the technical terminology or formatting further?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


Welcome
Improvement Area 1: External Web Client Architecture
	•	Implement independent module architecture where client servers maintain their own session lifecycles
	•	Integrate modern authentication mechanisms with KeepAlive functionality at the system level
Improvement Area 2: Secure Identity Management
	•	Avoid exchanging sensitive identities (CompanyId) via SAML Response to service applications
	•	Implement secure identity token patterns
Improvement Area 3: Centralized Authorization
	•	Avoid having each module maintain its own authorization patterns
	•	Establish a unified authorization framework
Improvement Area 4: Session Management
	•	Address multiple logout calls from external web clients
	•	Implement coordinated session termination
Key grammar corrections made:
	•	“maintainz” → “maintain”
	•	“tieir” → “their”
	•	“authoization” → “authorization”
	•	“Exchnage” → “exchanging”
	•	Added articles (“a unified framework”)
	•	Fixed sentence structure and verb tenses
	•	Corrected “SAMLResponse” → “SAML Response”
	•	Improved parallel structure in bullet points
The text now follows proper grammar rules while maintaining the technical accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​



Improvement Area 1: Optimize outside web client handling.
	•	Decouple client session management from servers into independent modules.
	•	Improve heartbeat, session lifetime, and authentication mechanisms.
	•	Ensure “Keep Me Alive” functionality works at the module level.

Improvement Area 2: Avoid exchanging identities (e.g., CompanyId) through SAMLResponse when integrating with service applications.

Improvement Area 3: Standardize authorization.
	•	Prevent each module from maintaining its own authorization patterns.
	•	Streamline logout handling to avoid multiple logout calls from outside the web client.

Do you want me to make this more formal (like an official review document) or more concise (like slides/bullets for a presentation)?

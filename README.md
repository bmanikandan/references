Request for Contact Details – Tempus Issue Reporting

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

We are in the process of drafting the operational manual for the run-the-business team and need to include key contact details for CERT rotation or any production environment issues. Could you please provide the official email address, along with the designated communication channels or ticketing process for reporting issues with Tempus?

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

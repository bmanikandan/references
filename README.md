Subject: Approval Request for Apple Mac Laptop Refresh

Dear [Approverâ€™s Name],

I have raised a support request due to  C policies not syncing with my current laptop. After consulting with the Powerlink team, they have advised proceeding with a laptop refresh to resolve the issue.

As part of this process, I kindly request your approval for a new Apple Mac laptop. Please let me know if any further details are required.

Best regards,

	1.	Review of Existing Stories/Tasks/Epics
	•	Focus on previously created stories, tasks, and epics that are missing key attributes.
	•	These gaps are obstructing visibility into what’s completed, current progress, and the future direction.
	•	Emphasis on functional stories is critical at this stage.
	2.	Functional Story Alignment
	•	Prioritize functional stories, especially in light of the 100+ commercial use cases presented by Turan.
	•	Align roadmap items with these use cases to ensure coverage and clarity.
	3.	QA Task Assignment
	•	Assign QAs the responsibility to create test companies and record test evidence.
	•	This will serve as a reliable reference source and help in comparing the new solution against the existing system.
	4.	Technical Stories Handling
	•	Mark all technical stories as lowest priority for now.
	•	Turan and I will handle these directly and separately.

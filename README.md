ðŸ“¦ Scepter Error Handling Library for Spring Boot

This library provides a standardized, robust error-handling mechanism for RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot. It is designed to minimize ambiguity, reduce boilerplate, and ensure that all error responses are handled consistently and clearlyâ€”regardless of developer interpretation or custom exception design.

âœ… Key Features
	â€¢	Standards-Compliant Error Format
	â€¢	Implements RFC 9457 â€” Problem Details for HTTP APIs, published July 2023.
	â€¢	Supports extended, non-standard members to enable actionable client behavior based on error codes.
	â€¢	Accurate HTTP Status Codes
	â€¢	Errors return proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, 500, etc.) based on the error context.
	â€¢	Ensures that error semantics match the underlying cause.
	â€¢	Detailed, Structured Error Responses
	â€¢	Includes a unique error code, human-readable message, and context-specific details.
	â€¢	Designed to help clients understand and fix issues quickly.
	â€¢	Internationalization (i18n) Support
	â€¢	Default locale: en-US.
	â€¢	Seamless localization via message property files (messages_es.properties, messages_ja.properties, etc.).
	â€¢	No additional coding required to support new languages.
	â€¢	Unified Exception Treatment
	â€¢	Treats JDK exceptions and domain-specific custom exceptions equally.
	â€¢	Always produces a consistent response structure.
	â€¢	Fail-Fast Constraint Validation
	â€¢	Bean validation uses a fail-fast strategy to reduce CPU cycles for invalid requests.
	â€¢	Improves API performance by rejecting bad requests early in the request lifecycle.

ðŸ“Œ Benefits
	â€¢	Developers donâ€™t need to write boilerplate error handlers or worry about consistency.
	â€¢	Clients get predictable and machine-readable error responses.
	â€¢	Easy integration into any Spring Boot application without heavy customization.

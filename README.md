As part of the upcoming portal renovations, we are introducing Split IO to manage our feature flags. This will give us the ability to:

Release features in a phased and controlled manner

Reduce risks by limiting exposure during rollouts

Run A/B tests and experiments to validate performance and adoption

Increase overall confidence in deployments

By adopting this approach, we can ensure smoother releases while delivering value to users more quickly and reliably.

Please let us know what is required to bring this initiative into the PWO Renovation space, so we can plan accordingly and align dependencies.

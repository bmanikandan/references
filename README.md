continues to ignore API as a first call citizen and microservice pattern, and people are blindly following more than one container in a single pod.
HTTPS is the primary channel of communication between outer containers and inner containers inside a single pod using AUTH 2.0 along with PING and Brarrer tolen validations. Like a virus, these concepts spread throughout the organization. Stop polluting.
Ledership also enforces blindly the copy-paste culture without understanding the nuances behind the patterns described above, encouraging their teams to repeat the same mistakes.
A pod may contain several containers, where the outermost container handles most of the user traffic, while not all calls require the inner service to be online at the same time. A lot of read-only calls may be made, while some services may be used ten times a day.
To make sure all of the inter APIs are written carefully to make better use of the resources instead of putting together and demanding lots of CPUs and memory intensive code, it should not treat everything alike.
Signs-pod is not a solution for accelerating startup time or reducing CPU and memory usage. The industry is moving towards Native Image Kit, Spring Boot 3+ supports native imaging.
Our top leadership needs to escalate him to stop him bringing polluted ideas. We must ensure proper grovenrence on using more than one pod.
Unknown copy-paste. Interested in excluding some

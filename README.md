Status Update and Next Steps

Good Morning All,

Here’s a quick update on our current priorities and pending actions:
	•	We are currently occupied with other high-priority items, which has delayed progress on a few tasks.
	•	We have yet to test the use of aliases in the deployment repository for the header-based routing use case.
	•	We’re still awaiting samples from Kyle regarding Circuit Breaker, Retries, and Trace Logs to proceed further.
	•	An open discussion is needed on the PPG onboarding submission—this is primarily to complete the paperwork required for approval and move forward after the WBA (north-south) implementation.
	•	We plan to resume the security work early next week, focusing on enabling JWT validation at the Istio-proxy level, scoped only to the local APP mnemonic if feasible.

Please let me know if there are any updates or blockers from your side.

Fratus John made a valid point. In the case of development use, the pre-build binary version downloaded from the Oracle GraalVM website will stick to the Early Adopted version. In the case of production use, we may have to use the Enterprise version for native image builds. 

Currently at PNC, the developers use Oracle JDK for development, but in production, DevOps uses the Red Hat version of Open JDK.

I would like to convert this request to GraalVM Enterprise Edition.

Using the Shadowing experience (Cobrowse technology) significantly improves customer service IT operations by allowing customer service representatives (CSRs) to see exactly what customers are experiencing. Prior to the production release, it is important to prepare ahead of time. The technology should be designed as a safe one for internal use, with a slight variation from the traditional methods of screen sharing.
To put it simply, whatever service a customer requires, our CSR is there to help them every step of the way. Whenever a CR cannot be resolved using Shadowing Experience technology, they will collect evidence, screenshots, and raise MCC tickets based on the severity of the defect.

Shadowing (Cobrowse technology) is a powerful technology that significantly improves customer service IT operations by allowing customer service representatives (CSRs) to see exactly what customers are experiencing with a slight variation from the traditional screen sharing methods that have been used. Before the production release of the product, it is very important that this feature is enabled as early as possible prior to the release. There should be a focus on making this technology a safe cobrowsing experience that is restricted to real-only operations and internal use only. Putting it simply, our Customer Relations department is there for our customers at every step of the way, no matter what issue they may be facing. Unless a CSR representative is able to resolve the issue using Cobrowse Experience, he or she will collect evidence, screenshots, and raise a MCC ticket based on the severity of the reported issue (P1/P2/P3).

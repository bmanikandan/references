Developers often say that they are waiting for Manikandan's help, awaiting clarification despite 30+ days under development, calming the situation by not moving forward.

Stories are uncooked by some BSAs.  Drag story creation in the name of technical guidance from Manikandan without analyzing the information they have. Come every morning with fresh mind as a new face starting from zero by completely forgot everything from the previous discussion.

Developers deliver bullshit. They don't meet their commitments. Such bullshit efforts are marked as completed and accepted by agile lovers.

Agile lovers are floating a story to many individuals in the name of best practice.

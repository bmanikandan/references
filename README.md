Charlie Crew is lucky to have Venkata Maddineni as the only Ul developer that they have. It is remarkable what he has contributed to PINACLE Payments (PPS) over the past 6 years
 As part of his work, he works closely with UX designers and devotes all his time to Angular upgrades.
As a result, he made sure he involved everyone, encouraged collaboration, and made sure mistakes were not repeated.
As a self-starter, he takes charge of his learning process Whenever he is developing the Ul, he always keeps in mind the responsiveness of the Ul with regard to the browser compatibility.

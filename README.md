We follow a Contract-First approach, and after development, the API documentation is exposed via Swagger UI at the API level for all non-prod environments.
The manually crafted Swagger JSON created during the early stages is no longer maintained beyond that point, as any future changes are automatically reflected in the Swagger output.

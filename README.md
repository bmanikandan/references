I was misled by Tarun into believing that no decision had been made regarding the wave migration until today. Additionally, Tarun unnecessarily brought up the Reactive Programming topic in last week’s design review meeting, which led to over an hour of debating. The amount of energy he spent pushing back on the Reactive Programming topic could have been better spent on the learning path—in which case, we would likely be in better shape by now.

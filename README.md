Subject: Clarification and Enhancement of Roles for Discovery Crew – Architects

Good Morning,

Currently, the role of an Architect within the Discovery Crew is loosely defined—often limited to creating block diagrams and a few lines of supporting text. This has led to a lack of clarity and inconsistent outcomes, particularly when developers interpret the limited input in their own way, which has historically caused misalignment and project delays.

I believe the role of the Architect should go beyond high-level visuals. It must include ownership of the detailed technical design for each epic. This includes:
	•	Schema Design
	•	Data Modeling
	•	Flow Diagrams
	•	API Specifications

We are dealing with epics that span over 2 months, yet the output in Confluence is often reduced to a single, high-level page that fails to provide actionable guidance to the development team. This is insufficient for successful execution.

To ensure alignment and reduce rework, the Discovery Crew Architects must deliver comprehensive, practical documentation as part of their responsibilities. These should serve as the source of truth for development, QA, and downstream teams.

I propose we formally define and adopt these extended responsibilities to bridge the current gaps and ensure smoother delivery.

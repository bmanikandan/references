Gracias, this is not our preferred option, but for the time being we will be using the stores' collection. As any changes to the collection name and other attributes may result in code changes at the end of this sprint, this story MSESL-1073 may be logically marked as completed at the end of this sprint, but it is not 100% complete at this time. The continual extension of work after spending a lot of energy as a team and then doing undo and redo as well as retesting is not a good sign at all. It would be possible to solve this problem within one hour if AL team was flexible in coordinating with lead people.
There is a lot of potential in Scepter, but the scope for v1.1 has been reduced to PayPac.
According to the initial discussions with Kyle and Tempus, a MID (Merchant Id) can also be linked to multiple RNIDs in addition to its MID. PayFac was developed with the purpose of serving small businesses and single owners. As a result, the PayFac team may decide to use MID as the primary attribute for the linkage.
Is it necessary to carry over the same decision to the Scepter space as well?. The decision may be subject to reevaluation, in light of the fact that we give less priority to releasing a specific solution. If you prefer, we can discuss once again with Tempus on the same topic and determine the best possible scalable solution as soon as possible.

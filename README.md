The current configuration publishing strategy from SVM is not optimized. Instead of sending settings targeted to specific applications (mnemonics), they’re pushing all settings to all services. This leads to inefficiencies where irrelevant data reaches our proxy layer (ISTIO), impacting system performance. Unless the SVM team updates their approach to send only what’s needed per service, every new mnemonic addition will force teams to allocate more memory—affecting scalability and cost.

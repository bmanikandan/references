Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing migration, we successfully repointed all QA2 API consumers to the Tetrate Service Mesh (TSM) endpoints last weekâ€”except for Apigee. Please ensure that you are using TSM mesh routes and not the OCP-exclusive routes for the services listed below that are running in APP-QA2.

To prevent further confusion or incorrect usage of deprecated URLs, we have removed all related OCP Routes today (marked in RED in the list). If you experience any issues accessing services, please switch to the correct TSM URL (marked in GREEN).

ðŸ”” Note:
If you have any questions or need assistance with this transition, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Originally, istio-proxy was designed to operate with ½ CPU and ½ GB of memory. As part of our long-term optimization effort, we had requested to maintain this baseline.
	2.	Due to technical issues encountered last week, we were instructed to temporarily increase memory allocation from ½ GB to 2 GB to prevent pod failures.
	3.	As of today, we are reverting to the original resource configuration (½ CPU / ½ GB memory). This configuration is pending validation in the app-qa2 environment.
	4.	We request all teams to continue partnering with us in this optimization effort. This initiative should not be blocked under the justification of Load Testing evidence, especially after several months of focused work.

Furthermore, we request full access to the Tetrate R&D environment for application teams. Enabling wider access and participation will help us:
	•	Accelerate our adoption and integration efforts.
	•	Encourage broader talent engagement.
	•	Maximize the potential of the Tetrate platform.

Thank you for your continued support.

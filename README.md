After joining the project, I introduced three key technical directions aligned with our long-term scalability and modernization goals:
	1.	Adoption of JDK 21 – Leveraging the latest LTS version for improved performance, language enhancements (e.g., virtual threads, pattern matching), and long-term support.
	2.	Spring Reactive Stack – To better handle concurrent workloads and build a more responsive and resilient architecture suitable for our event-driven and asynchronous requirements.
	3.	Deliberate Non-Adoption of Micronaut – After evaluation, we decided not to proceed with Micronaut at this stage to maintain alignment with our current ecosystem, team skillsets, and roadmap maturity.

Please feel free to tag me as the decision owner for these directions.

The benefits of these decisions have become increasingly evident since our move to production—particularly in terms of system responsiveness, resource efficiency, and developer productivity.

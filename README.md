The current design is incomplete and requires significant improvement. Please refrain from submitting partially thought-out or placeholder work, and avoid suggesting that additional requirements are being added by reviewers. The Phase-1 scope has been clearly defined, and it is not acceptable to defer essential components to post-v1.2 under the guise of “incremental growth.”

The data flow diagram provided lacks critical details expected even for Phase-1. Please address the following gaps:
	1.	Response Structure: Clearly outline the structure of each section that constitutes the monthly report. Include actual JSON response samples for at least the three sections we have received from Poonam.
	2.	Supporting Artifacts:
	•	Attach the Postman collection for the queries received so far.
	•	Include the Monthly Statement Report template.
	3.	Data Persistence: Describe how each section’s data is organized and stored in MongoDB. This includes:
	•	MongoDB schema details for each section’s response.
	4.	API Documentation: Provide OpenAPI specifications for the Statement API.
	5.	Error Handling & Recovery: Explain the mechanism to restart the sequence flow if it fails mid-process.
	6.	System Orchestration:
	•	Detail how the orchestrator delegates tasks to data collectors and the PDF generation component.
	•	Explain how the system ensures scalability and parallel processing to generate reports for 3000+ merchants efficiently.
	•	Clarify how communication occurs between the orchestrator, data collectors, and report creators.

Please treat every deliverable as an opportunity to demonstrate quality and ownership. The items listed above are all within the defined Phase-1 scope and must be addressed comprehensively.

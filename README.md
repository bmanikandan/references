Good Morning Brad,

This note is specific to Commercial. The new solution will serve both Commercial and Corporate, though the initial release is focused on Commercial. We need to consider traffic from both segments.

There are two types of testing involved:
	1.	Web UI testing
	2.	API testing

The 100 TPS target applies to API testing. At this point, can we move away from the current 1 TPS solutions?

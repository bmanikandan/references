The APP mnemonic leads are looking to understand the real value add of TSB beyond basic Layer-4 routing use cases. They are open to being flexible with the TSB+APP release timeline, potentially moving it to July or August.
	•	A meeting is scheduled with Emily and Steve on Monday to prioritize APP use cases.
	•	The APP mnemonic prefers in-process bearer token validation rather than using an out-of-process validation pattern (i.e., external authorization).
The security discussion has been parked until the meeting with Steve.
	•	Initial discussions have begun around key features such as header-based routing, retries, and tracing logs.
	•	The team will need expertise and support from Yama and Kyle to implement these capabilities in QA2, and will discuss them during the upcoming office hours call.

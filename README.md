Fratus John made a valid point. In the case of development use, the pre-build binary version downloaded from the Oracle GraalVM website will stick to the Early Adopted version. In the case of production use, we may have to use the Enterprise version for native image builds. 

The point made by Fratus John is valid. The pre-build binary version downloaded from the Oracle GraalVM website will adhere to the Early Adopted version suitable for development use. It may be necessary to use the Enterprise version for native image builds in the case of production use.

Currently at PNC, the developers use Oracle JDK for development, but in production, DevOps uses the Red Hat version of Open JDK.

I would like to convert this request to GraalVM Enterprise Edition.

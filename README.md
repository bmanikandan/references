Hello Mark,
On Sep 26th, you, Imithias, I, Yogesh and Sathish put a lot of energy into identifying the remaining work sets that needed to be completed for the external portal (see the attached worksheet for more information). 

As a result of these 65+ work items, we have scaled the team headcounts and have committed to have them completed by mid November 2024. It would be a disaster if we failed to do so.

I think we should stick to this plan, tag the story numbers on the Excel spreadsheet, and continue to monitor the story progress using JIRA board in order to stick to this schedule.

Team,
I would appreciate it if you could update the minutes of the meeting, since I arrived 20 minutes late.
I can provide you with the minutes that were discussed from the point at which I joined the meeting, as far as I am aware.

On the Transactions view page, consider including Fees as a display item at the same time as the settlement amount after the fee calculation has been done.
   There is a side panel that shows the details of each transaction within the Transactions microapp.
   Once the design page has been completed, Joy will release it to the DEV team and work with them as well as the business sponsors in parallel to make sure the look and feel is approved.
   Yogesh prepared the internal service plan and is ready to socialize with Shiv and Manikandan once the service has been completed

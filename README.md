During todayâ€™s call, Tanveer primarily focused on building components for the header elements, such as the logo and utility menu items. He mentioned that his focus this week will shift to developing the navigation components.

If the header section is completed and ready for integration, the backend team can proceed without any interruptions. In the meantime, while waiting for Whisgy to finalize the navigation components, is there any existing menu component we can begin working with as a placeholder or starting point?

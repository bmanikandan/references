Shiv,

Please coordinate with Justin to ensure that our External Services and Internal FS are successfully onboarded to the new server, as the Trend Macro team is in the process of upgrading to the new environment.

Additionally, please include the sequence diagram for the manual Misc. Fees flow.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like any further refinements!

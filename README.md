APP mnemonic consist of four distinct environents, namely R&D, UAT, QA2, QA4, and PROD, that are the components of the APP project. As part of our secure password management program, we would like to store passwords in a secure location vault that supports MongoDB, Kafka, PNC Inner API ClientID, and Client Secrets. In the beginning, the passwords will be set up by the application team to be vaulted by the application team. A password of this type should not be reviewed automatically by a computer system. Ideally, we would prefer that OCP get the password from the vault before running the PODS from the Vault.

Apologies for the delayed response. Could you please share the job description for the role?

Regarding the candidate, I recommend considering him for a Senior Developer position. While he was able to address the questions, most of his responses remained at a surface level, and he did not demonstrate in-depth knowledge in his area of expertise.

I’ve exported the pnc-spring-boot-exceptions-starter library’s README.md file to PDF and attached it here. This library provides a consistent error response structure for all Spring Boot exceptions—whether they are handled, unhandled, standard framework errors, or custom business exceptions. Most of the intended audience is new to the project, except for myself, Gowtham, and Nikhil.

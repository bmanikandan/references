We would appreciate your assistance in understanding the fact that the GraalVM JDK21 request was submitted on (EA0112709)
The technology was initiated by us and has been approved for the proof-of-concept, only a couple of months after the 09-15-2023:54:29, and we are also demonstrating the proof-of-concept to CIOs during our innovation showcase on February 29th 2024. We were unaware that the ownership of the lower version of GraalVM JDK17 had been transferred to another group without our permission. The request for GraalVM JDK21 was stuck, which caused a lot of delays and pain, so the request was escalated to the leadership team in order to connect with the other leads. The EA team is being converted to the hardest path to follow.

At the same time, another team submitted EA0110001 08-15-2022 09:27:11 for the Temporal v1.17.2 that got approved for POC. However, they did not proceed with further development after the POC due to some budget constraints. We would like to proceed with the latest version 1.25.2 submitted on EA0115103 11-12-2024 22:00:26 after a period of two years. In the process of transferring ownership, it was stuck. This again causes a lot of delay. Pain, escalation to the leadership team to connect with other leads on the project. It has also been converted into the hardest path as well.

We strive to work hard to bring the visionary products to PNC and ease the product development. Some point we are getting demotivated forcing us to stop thinking to bring innovative ideas. 

Help visionaries to stay away from the hardest path route like this. 

Thank you!
